\subsection{Remote vs Local Library}
In the above section we saw the interconnect overhead in terms of slowdown, when we try to fetch data from remote node.
Similar overhead exist in the case when read-only data is being fetched from remote node.
Here our read-only data is the shared library's instructions.
The shared library was placed on Node03 and then we ran the main thread on each of the four nodes.
Main thread called 0.1 million functions from the library in sequential order.
Figure XX shows the result.
We measured the total number of CPU cycles consumed, stalled cycles and page faults in each case.
We observed that in the case when our main thread was running locally (i.e. on Node03) minimum number of CPU cycles were consumed, and stalled cycles were also minimum.
We measured page faults to make sure that we are fetching equal number of library pages in all four cases, and number of page faults were equal in all four cases.
